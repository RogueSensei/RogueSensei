# RogueSensei
The only thing greater than computers and code is a cup of tea. I drink tea and I code things.

My favourite language is C++; I also like plain old C, C# and Python.
### My personal projects
- Wilson, my discord bot.
- clogger, a tiny logging library
- 秘密, not yet ready for the public

Consider inviting Wilson to your own discord server by clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=370210465672069122&permissions=8&scope=bot).

Thanks for stopping by, happy hacking!
